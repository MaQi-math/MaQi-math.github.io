\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}

In this blog, we look into the stationary Navier-Stokes equation:

$$
\begin{cases}
  -\nu \Delta u + (u\cdot \nabla) u + \nabla p = 0 \\
  \mbox{div } u = 0
\end{cases}
$$

where $u: \mathbb{R}^n\to \mathbb{R}^n$ is a vector field, $p:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ is a function. $u$ and $p$ are unknown. 
Stationary Navier-Stokes has been investigated for more than a century and we still know little about it until recently.
Many problems arise and still open in dimension $n=2,3$. 

## Boundary Value Problem

Given $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be a bounded open domain, with $C^1$ boundary. The BVP come out naturally:

$$
\begin{cases}
  -\nu \Delta u + (u\cdot \nabla) u + \nabla p = 0 \quad \mbox{in } \Omega \\
  \mbox{div } u = 0 \quad \mbox{in } \Omega  \\
  u = a \quad \mbox{on } \partial\Omega
\end{cases}
$$

The fundamental work is Leray's theory in 1930s. The most important tool is the Leray-Schauder fixed point theorem:

<div class="theorem" text='Leray-Schauder Theorem'>
    Let $H$ be a Hilbert spcae and $K:H\to H$ be a compact operator. Then for the equation $x=Kx$, there exists a solution if 
    for all $\lambda \in [0,1]$, the possible solutions to $x_{\lambda} = \lambda Kx_{\lambda}$ are uniformly bounded, i.e.

    $$
      \sup_{\lambda\in[0,1]} \Vert x_{\lambda} \Vert_H \le +\infty
    $$
