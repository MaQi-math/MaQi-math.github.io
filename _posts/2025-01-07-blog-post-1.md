In this blog, we will see some basic information of Navier-Stokes Equation, Euler Equation, and related problems.

# Navier-Stokes Equation
Navier-Stokes equations (NS eqn for abbreviation) describe the **viscous incompressible flow**. It is a PDE system taking the following form:

$$
  \begin{aligned} 
    \partial_t u - \nu \Delta u + u\cdot \nabla u + \nabla p = f \\
    \mbox{div } u = 0
  \end{aligned}
  \tag{1}
  \label{NS}
$$

where $$u(t,x):\ \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n$$ is a vector field, in physical model it denotes the velocity field;
$$p:\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^n\to \mathbb{R}$$ is a single-valued function, which denotes the pressure; and $$f$$ is also a vector field, who denotes the force in physical model. When we say $$\nabla u$$, div $$u$$, we always mean the derivative to the space variable $$x$$. $$\nu$$ is a constant, called 'kinetic vicosity', or 'viscosity' for simplicity.

Given $$f$$, our goal is to find a pair of $$(u,p)$$ to satisfy the equations. However, in most contexts, we omit $$p$$ since it is not essential in the integral equation, only say to find a solution $$u$$.

The nonlinear term of NS eqn is $$u\cdot \nabla u$$.

Main Problems
----

- Initial Value Problem. In $$\mathbb{R}^n$$, Give $$u_0$$ satisfying compatible condition div $$u_0 = 0$$, find a solution $$u(t,x)$$ such that it solves PDE $$\eqref{NS}$$ and $$u(0,x) = u_0$$. 

# Stationary Navier-Stokes Equation

Also called Steady Navier-Stokes Equation in some literature. We look for a time-independent solution of Navier-Stokes Equations, i.e., we assume $$u(x),p(x),f(x)$$ all independent of time variable $$t$$. Then we got the following Stationary Navier-Stokes Euqation:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    -\nu \Delta u + u \cdot \nabla u + \nabla p = f \\
    \mbox{div } u = 0
  \end{aligned}
  \tag{2}
  \label{SNS}
$$

Intuitively, if a global solution to NS eqn $$\eqref{NS} u(t,x)$$ has a limit in some sense when $$t \to \infty$$, i.e. $$u(t,x) \to u_{\infty}(x)$$ for some $$u_{\infty}$$, then $$u_{\infty}$$ shall solve the Sationary NS eqn. One would notice that the Stationary NS eqn is an elliptic eqn.

Problems
----
- Boundary Value Problem (BVP). Especially in dimension 2 and 3. Given $$\Omega$$ bounded $$C^1$$ open set, $$u = a$$ on $$\partial \Omega$$. By divergence free condition div $$u = 0$$, we have compatible condition for BVP:
  
 $$
  \begin{aligned}
  \int_{\partial\Omega} a \cdot n\ dS = \int_{\Omega}  \mbox{div } u\ dx = 0
  \end{aligned}
$$

We call $$\mathcal{F} = \int_{\partial \Omega} a \cdot n \ dS$$ **total flux**. With total flux zero condition, the well-posedness problem of Stationary NS.

- Exterior Domain Problem. Let $$\Omega$$ be the complement of some bounded domain, consider Stationary NS eqn in $$\Omega$$. The well-posedness problem, or well-posedness property under further assumption like small data on $$\partial\Omega$$ or $$\lim_{\|x\|\to \infty} \|u(x)\|$$.

For example, the Liouville-type problem is to prove the triviality of $$u$$ when $$\Omega = \mathbb{R}^n$$, $$f = 0$$, and $$\lim_{\|x\|\to\infty} \|u(x)\| = 0$$

# Euler Equation

Euler Equation describe the inviscous incompressible flow. 'Inviscous' means the vicosity constant $$\nu = 0$$. Thus the equation takes the form of:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \partial_t u + u\cdot \nabla u + \nabla p = f \\
  \mbox{div } u = 0
\end{aligned}
\tag{3}
\label{Euler}
$$

# Stokes Problem

Stokes Problem is the linear part of Stationary NS eqn:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    -\nu \Delta u + \nabla u = f \\
    \mbox{div } u = 0
  \end{aligned}
  \tag{4}
  \label{Stokes}
$$
