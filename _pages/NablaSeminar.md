**Title: Generalising the Riemann Mapping Theorem to Several Complex Variables.**

Abstract: The Riemann Mapping Theorem is a fundamental result of the theory of one complex variable that classifies all simply connected domains up to biholomorphism. However, once one moves to just two complex variables, it is a famous result due to Poincaré that there cannot exist a biholomorphism between the unit ball and the unit polydisc. In this talk, we will describe some notions specific to several complex variables and introduce the Caratheodory and Kobayashi metrics. These distance-decreasing metrics, as we shall see, allow us to "measure" the failure of the Riemann Mapping Theorem. To finish, we will look at some generalisations of the mapping theorem to the higher dimensional setting.

**Title: Compactness and Limits of Energy for Origami**

Abstract: How does material choice affect the work needed to fold origami? In this talk, I'll present the basic modeling for elastic materials, and the progress I've made towards a Gamma convergence result. I'll show some theorems and open problems in my project. This talk will show some commonalities and differences between variational and classical PDE methods, and review some BV theory and GMT in service of the problem.

### 2025 Jan.31 , Speaker: [Qi Ma](https://maqi-math.github.io/)

**Title: Introduction to Sationary Navier-Stokes equation and Leray's Theory.**

Abstract: Navier-Stokes Equation describes the flow of imcompressible vicous fluid. In this talk, I will introduce the stationary Navier-Stokes equation and some classical work in the study of Navier Stokes equation, such as Helmoholtz decomposition, Leray-Schauder Theorem, and invading domain method. I will try to prove some basic existence theorems from Leray's Thm. Some recent results and open problems will also be presented if time permitted.

**Title：Must there be a boundary condition?**

Abstract：When solving parabolic/hyperbolic evolution equations in some region \Omega of \mathbb{R}^n, we are typically equipped with two things: initial data which holds at t=0 and a boundary condition which holds for all t>0. It's no surprise that we need initial data to solve for the evolution. The purpose of this talk is to ask: must there be a boundary condition? Given a one-parameter family of operators W(t):L^2(\Omega) to L^2(\Omega) with W(t)\psi satisfying the evolution equation in \Omega for all \psi, can we say that W(t)\psi must satisfy a boundary condition for all t>0? Does it even make sense to ask this question, given that these are L^2 functions and the boundary condition takes place on a measure zero subset of \Omega? In this talk we will answer this question and more for certain linear evolution equations motivated by quantum mechanics.

**Title：Minimizers for the Area Functional**

Abstract：The area functional is of linear growth in the gradient, so a natural space in which to pose the corresponding minimization problem is the W^1,1 Sobolev space. As it turns out, this space is too small, and we should instead consider the larger space of BV functions, and then extend our area functional to this space. I'll explain what this means, and state some results about structure of BV functions and their singularities that help us study this extended problem.

**Title：Infinitely many bubble solutions for the prescribed scalar curvature problem on $\mathbb{S}^N$**

Abstract：The prescribed scalar curvature problem on $\mathbb{S}^n$  asks if one can find a conformally invariant metric such that the curvature becomes a fixed smooth function. In the case that the given function is positive, rotationally symmetric and has a local maximum point between the poles, one can construct infinitely many non-radial positive solutions to this problem by applying Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction arguments. The energy of these solutions can be made arbitrarily large.

**Title: Regularity Theory of Energy Minimizing Maps between Riemannian Manifolds**

Abstract: By analysing the Dirichlet energy of harmonic functions, one can apply variational methods to get regularity of solutions even from weak solutions. However, int he case of harmonic maps, i.e. maps onto Riemannian manifolds, the situation is decidedly different as one has to contend with the geometry of the target. In this talk, we examine harmonic maps and elucidate how a result due to Schoen and Uhlenbeck gives us analogous regularity results.

**Title: Pseudo-differential operators and regularity for elliptic PDEs with smooth coefficients.**

Abstract: We will start by introducing the Kohn-Nirenberg symbols. 
We will then introduce Pseudodifferential operators (PsiDO) which enlarges the class of differential operators. We will then study the action of the PsiDOs on Schwartz functions and tempered distributions which allow us to understand certain smoothing properties. Then we will construct elliptic parametrix for elliptic PsiDOs which will in particular show regularity for any elliptic PDE with smooth coefficients, including Sobolev regularity for PDEs in the same class.

  **Title: Liouville theorems for second order conformally invariant equations and their applications** 

  Abstract: I will present optimal Liouville-type theorems for second order conformally invariant equations. A crucial new ingredient in proving these theorems is our enhanced understanding of solution behaviors near isolated singularities of such equations. These Liouville-type theorems lead to optimal local gradient estimates for a wide class of fully nonlinear elliptic equations involving Schouten (Ricci) tensors. As an application of these Liouville-type theorems  and gradient estimates, we establish new existence and compactness results for conformal metrics on a closed Riemannian manifold with prescribed symmetric functions of the Schouten (Ricci) tensor, allowing the scalar curvature of the conformal metrics to have varying signs.
